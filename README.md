angular-learning
================

This is just a learning course for myself

## Basic idea
It just for me for learning angularjs

I also add lots of nodejs package that may never use.

## How to use
Only have to execute app.js as normal

```
# node app.js
```

And then you may see the information that the sever runs at localhost port 20081
